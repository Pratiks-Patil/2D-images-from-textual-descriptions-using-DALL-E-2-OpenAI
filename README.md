# 2D-images-from-textual-descriptions-using-DALL-E-2-OpenAI

The key concept used in DALL·E 2 is the use of a transformer-based neural network
architecture that is pre-trained on a large corpus of text and image data. This pre-training
allows the model to learn a rich representation of both text and images, which it can then
use to generate novel images from textual descriptions.
Specifically, DALL·E 2 uses a two-stage approach to generate images from text. In the
first stage, the model uses a transformer-based language model to interpret the textual
description and generate a set of semantic features that capture the key concepts and
attributes of the image. In the second stage, the model uses a transformer-based image
generator to generate the corresponding image based on the semantic features. 

In conclusion, the modifications made to the code have greatly improved its
functionality and overall value. The addition of multiple image printing and the ability to
generate output images based on user input keywords has greatly enhanced the user
experience, creating a more engaging and personalized interaction with the program.
These modifications have made the program more versatile and relevant, allowing it to
better serve the needs of its users.
By using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine
learning algorithms, the generator is capable of generating visually-striking images based
on textual input, providing a unique and personalized visual experience for users. The
application’s ability to extract keywords from user input and generate relevant and
insightful images in response makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications,
from content creation to advertising and marketing.
However, it is important to note that the text to image generator is still in its early
stages of development and may have some limitations in terms of accuracy and
efficiency.
